# Programming challenge

This challenge demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, from preprocessing to model evaluation and tuning.

A dataset is provided with a training set and a validation set, without class labels.

I obtained a 75% accuracy test, close to teacher's best score of 77%. The ground truth labels are not available.
